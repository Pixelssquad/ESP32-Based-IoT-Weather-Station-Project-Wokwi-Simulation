# ESP32-Based-IoT-Weather-Station-Project-Wokwi-Simulation
Develop an ESP32 IoT Weather Station that retrieves real-time weather data via Wi-Fi from an API like OpenWeatherMap. Display temperature, humidity, and weather conditions on an OLED. Enable cloud data logging via Thingspeak. Simulate using platforms like Tinkercad. Connect, display, and log weather data seamlessly.
